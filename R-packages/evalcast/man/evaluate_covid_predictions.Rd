\title{Create a score card data frame based on covid forecasts}
\usage{
evaluate_covid_predictions(
  predictions_cards,
  err_measures = list(wis = weighted_interval_score, ae = absolute_error, coverage_80 =
    interval_coverage(coverage = 0.8)),
  backfill_buffer = 0,
  geo_type = c("county", "hrr", "msa", "dma", "state", "hhs", "nation"),
  offline_signal_dir = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictions_cards}{tibble of quantile forecasts, which contains at
least \code{quantile} and \code{value} columns, as well as any other prediction task
identifiers. Must be of class "predictions_cards". Covid predictions card
may be created by the function \code{\link[=get_predictions]{get_predictions()}}, downloaded with
\code{\link[=get_covidhub_predictions]{get_covidhub_predictions()}} or potentially created manually.}

\item{err_measures}{Named list of one or more functions, where each function
takes a data frame with three columns \code{quantile}, \code{value} and \code{actual}
(i.e., observed) returns a scalar measure of error. Null or an empty list
may be provided if scoring is not desired.}

\item{backfill_buffer}{How many days until response is deemed trustworthy
enough to be taken as correct? See details for more.}

\item{geo_type}{String indicating geographical type, such as "county", or
"state". See the \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_geography.html}{COVIDcast Geographic Coding documentation}
for available options.}

\item{offline_signal_dir}{a path to a directory where to cache downloaded data.
Data not cached if NULL.}
}
\value{
tibble of "score cards". Contains the same information as the
\code{predictions_cards()} with additional columns for each \code{err_measure} and
for the truth (named \code{actual}).

\description{
Evaluates the performance of a covid forecaster, through the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Takes a prediction card (as created by
\code{\link[=get_predictions]{get_predictions()}}).
\item Downloads from the COVIDcast API the latest available data to compute
what actually occurred (summing the response over the incidence period).
\item Computes various user-specified error measures.
}
Backfill refers to the process by which some data sources go back in time
updating previously reported values. Suppose it is September 14 and we are
evaluating our predictions for what happened in the previous epiweek
(September 6 through 12). Although we may be able to calculate a value for
"actual", we might not trust this value since on September 16, backfill may
occur changing what is known about the period September 6 through 12. There
are two consequences of this phenomenon.  First, running this function on
different dates may result in different estimates of the error. Second, we
may not trust the evaluations we get that are too recent.  The parameter
\code{backfill_buffer} specifies how long of a buffer period we should
enforce.  This will be dependent on the data source and signal and is left
to the user to determine.  If backfill is not relevant for the particular
signal you are predicting, then you can set \code{backfill_buffer} to 0.
