\usage{
plot_width(
  predictions_cards,
  facet_rows = "forecast_date",
  facet_cols = "forecaster",
  grp_vars = c("forecaster", "forecast_date", "ahead"),
  avg_vars = c("geo_value"),
  levels = c(0.5, 0.7, 0.9)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictions_cards}{tibble of predictions
that are all for the same prediction task, meaning they are for the same
response, incidence period,and geo type. Forecasts may be for a
different forecast date or forecaster.
A predictions card may be created by the function
\code{\link[=get_predictions]{get_predictions()}}, downloaded with \code{\link[=get_covidhub_predictions]{get_covidhub_predictions()}} or
possibly created manually. Alternatively, any data frame with columns
\code{quantile}, \code{value} and any grouping vars and averaging vars.}

\item{facet_rows}{A variable name to facet data over. Creates a
separate row of plots for each value of specified variable. Can be used
with \code{facet_cols} to create a grid of plots.  Should be passed to
plot_calibration when customized.}

\item{facet_cols}{Same as \code{facet_rows}, but with columns.}

\item{grp_vars}{variables over which to compare widths The first
determines the color of the lines while the rest will be faceted over}

\item{avg_vars}{variables over which we compute quantiles.}

\item{levels}{Quantile levels for the summary of interval width, to be
plotted. For example, \code{levels = c(0.5, 0.7, 0.9)}, the default, plots the
median, 70\% and 90\% quantiles of interval widths.}

\description{
Plot interval width
}
\details{
Interval width does not depend on the actual outcome, so this
function can be called on predictions cards in addition to score cards.
