\usage{
download_signal(
  data_source,
  signal,
  start_day = NULL,
  end_day = NULL,
  geo_type = "county",
  geo_values = "*",
  as_of = NULL,
  time_type = "day",
  offline_signal_dir = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_source}{a data source in covidcast.}

\item{signal}{a signal in covidcast.}

\item{start_day}{a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". First day of data to pull.}

\item{end_day}{a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". Last day of data to pull.}

\item{geo_type}{a geo type. One of "county", "state", "hrr", "msa", "nation", "hhs", "zip".}

\item{geo_values}{a geo value. If "*" all geo values returned, otherwise it should be a list of the geo values to query
e.g. c("ak", "ca") for states.}

\item{as_of}{a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". Pulls the latest issue of the data available in covidcast on this date.}

\item{time_type}{a string. For most signals this is "day", but for a select few this is "week". Check Epidata docs for info.}

\item{offline_signal_dir}{the directory that stores the cached data for each (signal, forecast day) pair. If this is
null, no caching is done and the data is downloaded from covidcast. The data is stored in a csv file with the format
'offline_signal_dir/data-source_signal_geo-type_as-of.csv`. Warning: no intelligent fetching is done, so if you request
the same signal, geo type, and as of, but vary the other parameters (non-empty symmetric difference geo_value subsets or
non-empty symmetric difference start_day and end_day arguments), then the cache will return the result of the first call
for later calls. To avoid this and use caching, make sure to make a call that fetches all the data you anticipate to use
first and then request subsets. You can use populate_cache() below to fetch all the needed data.}
