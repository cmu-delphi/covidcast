#' @param signals Tibble with columns `data_source` and `signal` that specifies
#'   which variables from the COVIDcast API will be used by `forecaster`. Each
#'   row of `signals` represents a separate signal, and first row is taken to be
#'   the response. If using incidence_period "epiweek", the response should be
#'   something for which summing daily values over an epiweek makes sense (e.g.,
#'   counts or proportions but not log(counts) or log(proportions)). Available
#'   data sources and signals are documented in the [COVIDcast signal
#'   documentation](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html).
#'   An optional column `start_day` can also be included. This can be a Date
#'   object or string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD", indicating the earliest date of
#'   data needed from that data source. Importantly, `start_day` can also be a
#'   function (represented as a list column) that takes a forecast date and
#'   returns a start date for model training (again, Date object or string in
#'   the form "YYYY-MM-DD"). The latter is useful when the start date should be
#'   computed dynamically from the forecast date (e.g., when `forecaster` only
#'   trains on the most recent 4 weeks of data).
