In this vignette, we'll take a look at estimating derivatives of signals using
the `estimate_deriv()` function. We'll again demonstrate this functionality on 
state-level COVID-19 case rates, smoothed via 7-day trailing averages, from the 
USAFacts data source. 

```{r}
library(covidcast)

start_day <- "2020-06-01"
end_day <- "2020-11-15"
geo_values <- c("ca", "fl", "ny", "tx")

case_rates <- suppressMessages(
  covidcast_signal(data_source = "usa-facts", 
                   signal = "confirmed_7dav_incidence_prop",
                   start_day = start_day, end_day = end_day, 
                   geo_type = "state", geo_values = geo_values))

summary(case_rates)
```

## Estimating derivatives via linear regression

The function for estimating derivatives is called `estimate_deriv()`, and (aside
from a `covidcast_signal` data frame) takes two primary arguments: `method`, 
indicating the method to use for derivative estimation; and `n` indicating the 
trailing sample size (number of days) to use in training the given method. Here 
we use `method = "lin"`, the default, which uses the slope from a simple linear 
regression, and `n = 14`, also the default. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(modeltools)
library(dplyr)

case_rates <- estimate_deriv(case_rates, method = "lin", n = 14)

case_rates %>% 
  arrange(geo_value) %>% 
  select(geo_value, time_value, value, deriv) 
```

We can see that a column `deriv` has been added to the output data frame, which
contains the derivative estimates. Below we visualize these estimates in tandem
with the signal itself. The red dots mark time points at which the derivative 
estimate exceeds a threshold (arbitrarily chosen) of 0.25. These seem to roughly
but reasonably mark times of upswing in the underlying signal. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

state = "fl"
threshold = 0.25

p1 <- ggplot(case_rates %>% filter(geo_value == state),
             aes(x = time_value, y = value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(data = case_rates %>% 
               filter(geo_value == state, deriv >= threshold),
             aes(x = time_value, y = value), color = "red") + 
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Cases per 100,00 people") 

p2 <- ggplot(case_rates %>% filter(geo_value == state),
             aes(x = time_value, y = deriv)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = threshold, linetype = 2) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Derivative (linear regression)") 

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

## Estimating derivatives via smoothing spline

Now we consider `method = "ss"`, which uses a smoothing spline for the estimate
of the derivative. That is, at each time point, we fit a natural cubic spline to 
the data from the trailing `n` days, and return the derivative of the underlying 
fitted spline at the current time as the estimate. Here we set `n = 28`, a bit
higher sample size, and fit the spline in two ways: first, using a fixed degrees 
of freedom of 8; and second, using cross-validation to choose the amount of 
regularization (tuning parameter). This is accomplished by passing additional 
arguments to `estimate_deriv()`, which are in turn passed on to the underlying
function it uses to fit smoothing splines, `stats::smooth.spline()`. Note that 
we also set a custom name for the output column with the estimated derivatives, 
via the `col_name` argument.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
case_rates <- estimate_deriv(case_rates, method = "ss", n = 28,
                             col_name = "deriv_ss1", df = 8)

case_rates <- estimate_deriv(case_rates, method = "ss", n = 28,
                             col_name = "deriv_ss2", cv = TRUE)

p1 <- ggplot(case_rates %>% filter(geo_value == state), 
             aes(x = time_value, y = value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(data = case_rates %>% 
               filter(geo_value == state, deriv_ss1 >= threshold),
             aes(x = time_value, y = value), color = "red") + 
  geom_point(data = case_rates %>% 
               filter(geo_value == state, deriv_ss2 >= threshold),
             aes(x = time_value, y = value), color = "blue", shape = 21) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Cases per 100,00 people") 

p2 <- ggplot(case_rates %>% filter(geo_value == state), 
             aes(x = time_value)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = deriv_ss1), color = "red") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = deriv_ss2), color = "blue") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = threshold, linetype = 2) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Derivative (smoothing spline)") 

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

The estimated derivates---in red for the smoothing spline with a fixed degrees 
of freedom of 8, and in blue for that tuned by cross-validation---appear less
smooth than those above, from linear regression. Using cross-validation offers
more adaptivity to the time-varying level of smoothness, as is apparent from 
comparing the red and blue derivative estimates in October and November. 

## Estimating derivatives via trend filtering 

Lastly we consider `method = tf"`, which uses trend filtering for estimating the
derivative. That is, at each time point, we fit a discrete spline of quadratic
order to the data from the trailing `n` days, and return the discrete derivative 
of the underlying fitted spline at the current time as the estimate. As before,
we fit the spline in two ways: first, using a fixed degrees of freedom of 8; and 
second, using cross-validation to choose the amount of regularization. Since the
optimization here takes a while (it's based on computing a full solution path  
for the trend filtering problem, via the `genlasso::trendfilter()` function), we
only compute derivatives for Florida.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
case_rates_state <- case_rates %>% filter(geo_value == state)

case_rates_state <- estimate_deriv(case_rates_state, method = "tf", n = 28, 
                                   col_name = "deriv_tf1", df = 8)

case_rates_state <- estimate_deriv(case_rates_state, method = "tf", n = 28, 
                                   col_name = "deriv_tf2", cv = TRUE)

p1 <- ggplot(case_rates_state, aes(x = time_value, y = value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(data = case_rates_state %>% filter(deriv_tf1 >= threshold),
             aes(x = time_value, y = value), color = "red") + 
  geom_point(data = case_rates_state %>% filter(deriv_tf2 >= threshold),
             aes(x = time_value, y = value), color = "blue", shape = 21) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Cases per 100,00 people") 

p2 <- ggplot(case_rates_state, aes(x = time_value)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = deriv_tf1), color = "red") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = deriv_tf2), color = "blue") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = threshold, linetype = 2) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Derivative (trend filtering)") 

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

The estimated derivates now appear a bit smoother than the last ones, from the 
smoothing spline methods. Again, using cross-validation offers a noticeable 
improvement in adapting to to the time-varying level of smoothness, as is very 
clear from the differences between red and blue derivative estimates in October 
and November. 

## Post-hoc inspection

In the call to `estimate_deriv()`, we can set `keep_obj = TRUE` to keep around a
second column with the fitted model objects. For example, here, we can look at 
the p-values associated with the estimated slopes from `lsfit()`. 

```{r}
case_rates <- estimate_deriv(case_rates, method = "lin", n = 14, 
                             keep_obj = TRUE)

class(case_rates$deriv_obj)
ls.print(case_rates$deriv_obj[[7]])
         
case_rates <- case_rates %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(p_value = quiet(
    tryCatch(ls.print(deriv_obj)$coef.table[[1]][2,"Pr(>|t|)"], 
             error = function(e) NA))) 

case_rates %>% 
  arrange(geo_value) %>% 
  select(geo_value, time_value, value, deriv, deriv_obj, p_value)
```
