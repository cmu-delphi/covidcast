\title{Create a training and prediction matrices for a given ahead.}
\usage{
create_train_and_predict_matrices(lagged_df, ahead, training_window_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{lagged_df}{Data frame of lagged data.  It should have the following columns:
- \code{geo_value}:  strings of geographic locations
- \code{time_value}:  Dates of training data
- columns of the form \code{value-{days}:{signal}} whose values correspond to {signal} {days} #'       before \code{time_value}.
- columns of the form \code{value+{days}:{response}} whose values correspond to {response} {days}
after \code{time_value}.  Since columns beginning with "value+" are interpretted as the
response rather than a covariate, observed data from the same day as \code{time_value} should
be in columns \code{value-0:{signal}} rather than \code{value+0:{signal}}.
A data frame in this format can be made using \code{covidcast::aggregate_signals()}.}

\item{ahead}{Number of days ahead to forecast}

\item{training_window_size}{Size of the local training window in days to use. For example, if
\code{training_window_size = 14}, then to make a 1-day-ahead forecast on December 15, we train on
data from December 1 to December 14.}
}
\value{
Named list with entries:
- \code{train_x}:  Matrix of training data whose columns correspond to the \code{value-{days}:{signal}}
columns in \code{lagged_df}.  The training data consists of the latest date \code{d} such that there #'       is an observed response at time \code{d + ahead} and all data from the \code{training_window_size}
days prior to it.
- \code{train_y}:  Vector of response data from the \code{value+{ahead}:{response}} column of
\code{lagged_df} corresponding to the rows of \code{train_x}.
- \code{predict_x}:  Matrix of prediction data in the same format as \code{train_x}.  The prediction #'        data contains the most recent \code{training_window_size} days.
- \code{predict_geo_values}:  Vector of \code{geo_values} corresponding to the rows of \code{predict_x}.
