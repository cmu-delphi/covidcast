\title{Plot interval coverage}
\usage{
plot_coverage(
  scorecards,
  type = c("all", "one"),
  grp_vars = c("forecaster", "forecast_date", "ahead"),
  avg_vars = c("geo_value"),
  coverage = 0.8,
  legend_position = "bottom"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scorecards}{List of different score cards, all on the same forecasting
task (i.e., same ahead, etc.).}

\item{type}{One of "all" or "none", indicating whether to show coverage
across all nominal levels (in which case averaging is performed across
\code{avg_vars}) or whether to show it for one specific alpha
value.}

\item{grp_vars}{variables over which to compare coverage. The first
determines the color of the lines while the rest will be faceted over}

\item{avg_vars}{variables over which we average to determine the proportion
of coverage. If \code{type = "one"},}

\item{coverage}{If \code{type = "one"}, then coverage is the nominal interval
coverage shown.}

\item{legend_position}{Legend position, the default being "bottom".}
