\usage{
get_target_response(signals, forecast_dates, incidence_period, ahead, geo_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{signals}{Tibble with columns \code{data_source} and \code{signal} that specifies
which variables from the COVIDcast API will be used by \code{forecaster}. Each
row of \code{signals} represents a separate signal, and first row is taken to be
the response. If using \code{incidence_period = "epiweek"}, the response should
be something for which summing daily values over an epiweek makes sense
(e.g., counts or proportions but not log(counts) or log(proportions)).
Available data sources and signals are documented in the \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html}{COVIDcast signal documentation}.
An optional column \code{start_day} can also be included. This can be a Date
object or string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD", indicating the earliest date of
data needed from that data source. Importantly, \code{start_day} can also be a
function (represented as a list column) that takes a forecast date and
returns a start date for model training (again, Date object or string in
the form "YYYY-MM-DD"). The latter is useful when the start date should be
computed dynamically from the forecast date (e.g., when \code{forecaster} only
trains on the most recent 4 weeks of data).}

\item{forecast_dates}{Vector of Date objects (or strings of the form
"YYYY-MM-DD") indicating dates on which forecasts will be made.}

\item{incidence_period}{String indicating the incidence period, either
"epiweek" or "day".}

\item{ahead}{Vector of (one or more) integers. How many epiweeks/days ahead
are you forecasting? If \code{incidence_period = "epiweek"} and forecast_date is
Sunday or Monday, then \code{ahead = 1} means the epiweek that includes the
forecast date; if \code{forecast_date} falls on a Tuesday through Saturday, then
it is the following epiweek. If \code{incidence_period = "day"}, then \code{ahead = 1} means the day after forecast date.}

\item{geo_type}{String indicating geographical type, one of "county", "dma",
"hrr", "msa", or "state".}
