Description: This package is a tool for those developing probabilistic COVID-19
    forecasters.  It provides functionality for accurately evaluating 
    forecaster performance.  Crucially, evalcast leverages the covidcast R 
    package's "as of" capability, which allows one to get the data that would 
    have been known as of a particular date in the past.  This is important for
    honest evaluation of COVID-19 forecasters because data sources often
    perform "backfill" in which previous estimates about the past are updated.
    Without properly accounting for backfill, traditional backtesting can lead
    to overly optimistic evaluations of one's forecaster.  Furthermore, naively
    training on historical data that has already been backfilled may lead a 
    trained model to rely too heavily on the most recent data that has yet to
    settle.  Such forecasters may end up performing far worse in prospective 
    evaluation than in backtesting.
