#' Simple quantile autoregressive forecaster based on `quantgen`
#'
#' A simple quantile autoregressive forecaster based on `quantgen`, to be used
#' with `evalcast`, via [evalcast::get_predictions()]. See the [quantgen
#' forecast
#' vignette](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/modeltoolsR/articles/quantgen-forecast.html)
#' for examples.
#' 
#' @param df Data frame of signal values to use for forecasting, of the format
#'   that is returned by [covidcast::covidcast_signals()].
#' @param forecast_date Date object or string of the form "YYYY-MM-DD",
#'   indicating the date on which forecasts will be made. For example, if
#'   `forecast_date = "2020-05-11"`, `incidence_period = "day"`, and `ahead =
#'   3`, then, forecasts would be made for "2020-05-14". 
#' @param signals Tibble with columns `data_source` and `signal` that specifies
#'   which variables are being fetched from the COVIDcast API, and populated in
#'   `df`. Each row of `signals` represents a separate signal, and first row is
#'   taken to be the response. An optional column `start_day` can also be
#'   included. This can be a Date object or string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD",
#'   indicating the earliest date of data needed from that data source.
#'   Importantly, `start_day` can also be a function (represented as a list
#'   column) that takes a forecast date and returns a start date for model
#'   training (again, Date object or string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD"). The
#'   latter is useful when the start date should be computed dynamically from
#'   the forecast date (e.g., when the forecaster only trains on the most recent
#'   4 weeks of data). 
#' @param incidence_period One of "day or "epiweek", indicating the period over
#'   which forecasts are being made. Default is "day".
#' @param ahead Vector of ahead values, indicating how many days/epiweeks ahead
#'   to forecast. If `incidence_period = "day"`, then `ahead = 1` means the day
#'   after forecast date. If `incidence_period = "epiweek"` and the forecast
#'   date falls on a Sunday or Monday, then `ahead = 1` means the epiweek that 
#'   includes the forecast date; if `forecast_date` falls on a Tuesday through
#'   Saturday, then it means the following epiweek.
#' @param n Size of the local training window (in days/weeks, depending on
#'   `incidence_period`) to use. For example, if `n = 14`, and `incidence_period
#'   = "day"`, then to make a 1-day-ahead forecast on December 15, we train on
#'   data from November 1 to November 14.
#' @param lags Vector of lag values to use as features in the autoregressive
#'   model. For example, when `incidence_period = "day"`, setting `lags = c(0,
#'   7, 14)`means we use the current value of each signal (defined by a row of
#'   the `signals` tibble), as well as the values 7 and 14 days ago, as the 
#'   features. Recall that the response is defined by the first row of the
#'   `signals` tibble. Note that `lags` can also be a list of vectors of lag
#'   values, this list having the same length as the number of rows of
#'   `signals`, in order to apply a different set of shifts to each signal. 
#'   Default is 0, which means no additional lags (only current values) for each
#'   signal.
#' @param tau Vector of quantile levels for the probabilistic forecast. If not
#'   specified, defaults to the levels required by the COVID Forecast Hub.
#' @param transform,inv_trans Transformation and inverse transformations to use
#'   for the response/features. The former `transform` can be a function or a
#'   list of functions, this list having the same length as the number of rows
#'   in the `signals` tibble, in order to apply the same transformation or a
#'   different transformation to each signal. These transformations will be
#'   applied before fitting the quantile model. The latter argument `inv_trans`
#'   specifies the inverse transformation to use on the response variable
#'   (inverse of `transform` if this is a function, or of `transform[[1]]` if
#'   `transform` is a list), which will be applied post prediction from the
#'   quantile model. Several convenience functions for transformations exist as
#'   part of the `quantgen` package. Default is `NULL` for both `transform` and
#'   `inv_trans`, which means no transformations are applied.
#' @param featurize Function to construct custom features before the quantile
#'   model is fit. As input, this function must take a data frame with columns
#'   `geo_value`, `time_value`, then the transformed, lagged signal values. This
#'   function must return a data frame with columns `geo_value`, `time_value`,
#'   then any custom features. The rows of the returned data frame *must not* be
#'   reordered.
#' @param noncross Should noncrossing constraints be applied? These force the
#'   predicted quantiles to be properly ordered across all quantile levels being
#'   considered. The default is `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, then noncrossing constraints
#'   are applied to the estimated quantiles at all points specified by the next
#'   argument.
#' @param noncross_points One of "all", "test", "train" indicating which points
#'   to use for the noncrossing constraints: the default "all" means to use both
#'   training and testing sets combined, while "test" or "train" means to use
#'   just one set, training or testing, respectively.
#' @param cv_type One of "forward" or "random", indicating the type of
#'   cross-validation to perform. If "random", then `nfolds` folds are chosen by
#'   dividing training data points randomly (the default being `nfolds = 5`). If
#'   "forward", the default, then we instead use a "forward-validation" approach
#'   that better reflects the way predictions are made in the current time
#'   series forecasting context. Roughly, this works as follows: the data points
#'   from the first `n - nfolds` time values are used for model training, and
#'   then predictions are made at the earliest possible forecast date after this 
#'   training period. We march forward one time point at a time and repeat. In
#'   either case ("random" or "forward"), the loss function used for computing
#'   validation error is quantile regression loss (read the documentation for
#'   `quantgen::cv_quantile_lasso()` for more details); and the final quantile
#'   model is refit on the full training set using the validation-optimal tuning
#'   parameter.
#' @param verbose Should progress be printed out to the console? Default is
#'   `FALSE`. 
#' @param ... Additional arguments. Any parameter accepted by
#'   `quantgen::cv_quantile_lasso()` (for model training) or by
#'   `quantgen:::predict.cv_quantile_genlasso()` (for model prediction) can be
#'   passed here. For example, `nfolds`, for specifying the number of folds used
#'   in cross-validation, or `lambda`, for specifying the tuning parameter
#'   values over which to perform cross-validation (the default allows
#'   `quantgen::cv_quantile_lasso()` to set the lambda sequence itself). Note
#'   that fixing a single tuning parameter value (such as `lambda = 0`)
#'   effectively disables cross-validation and fits a quantile model at the
#'   given tuning parameter value (here unregularized quantile autoregression).
#' 
#' @return Data frame with columns `ahead`, `geo_value`, `quantile`, and
#'   `value`. The `quantile` column gives the probabilities associated with
#'   quantile forecasts for that location and ahead.
