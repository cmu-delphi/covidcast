    """Download a Pandas data frame for one signal.

    Obtains data for selected date ranges for all geographic regions of the
    United States. Available data sources and signals are documented in the
    `COVIDcast signal documentation
    <https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html>`_.
    Most (but not all) data sources are available at the county level, but the
    API can also return data aggregated to metropolitan statistical areas,
    hospital referral regions, or states, as desired, by using the ``geo_type``
    argument.

    See the `COVIDcast API documentation
    <https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html>`_ for more
    information on available geography types, signals, and data formats.

    :param data_source: String identifying the data source to query, such as
      ``"fb-survey"``.
    :param signal: String identifying the signal from that source to query,
      such as ``"smoothed_cli"``.
    :param start_day: Query data beginning on this date. Provided as a
      ``datetime.date`` object. If ``start_day`` is ``None``, defaults to the
      first day data is available for this signal.
    :param end_day: Query data up to this date, inclusive. ``datetime.date``
      object. If ``end_day`` is ``None``, defaults to the most recent day data
      is available for this signal.
    :param geo_type: The geography type for which to request this data, such as
      ``"county"`` or ``"state"``. Available types are described in the
      COVIDcast signal documentation. Defaults to ``"county"``.
    :param geo_values: The geographies to fetch data for. The default, ``"*"``,
      fetches all geographies. To fetch one geography, specify its ID as a
      string; multiple geographies can be provided as an iterable (list, tuple,
      ...) of strings.
    :returns: A Pandas data frame with matching data. Each row is one
      observation on one day in one geographic location. Contains the following
      columns:

      ``geo_value``
        identifies the location, such as a state name or county FIPS code.
      ``time_value``
        contains a `pandas Timestamp object <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.html>`_
        identifying the date of this observation.
      ``value``
        the signal quantity requested. For example, in a query for the
        ``confirmed_cumulative_num`` signal from the ``usa-facts`` source,
        this would be the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the area, as
        of the ``time_value``.
      ``stderr``
        the value's standard error, if available.
      ``sample_size``
        indicates the sample size available in that geography on that day;
        sample size may not be available for all signals, due to privacy or
        other constraints.
      ``direction``
        uses a local linear fit to estimate whether the signal in this region is
        currently increasing or decreasing (reported as -1 for decreasing, 1 for
        increasing, and 0 for neither).

    Consult the signal documentation for more details on how values and standard
    errors are calculated for specific signals.

    The returned data frame contains one row per available signal, with the

        Data source name.

    ``signal``
        Signal name.

    ``min_time``
        First day for which this signal is available.

    ``max_time``
        Most recent day for which this signal is available.

    ``geo_type``
        Geographic level for which this signal is available, such as county,
        state, msa, or hrr. Most signals are available at multiple geographic
        levels and will hence be listed in multiple rows with their own
        metadata.

    ``time_type``
        Temporal resolution at which this signal is reported. "day", for
        example, means the signal is reported daily.

    ``num_locations``
        Number of distinct geographic locations available for this signal. For
        example, if `geo_type` is county, the number of counties for which this
        signal has ever been reported.

    ``min_value``
        The smallest value that has ever been reported.

    ``max_value``
        The largest value that has ever been reported.

    ``mean_value``
        The arithmetic mean of all reported values.

        The sample standard deviation of all reported values.
