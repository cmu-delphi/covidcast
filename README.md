Public-facing documents and tools supporting Delphi's
[COVIDcast](https://covidcast.cmu.edu) effort.

## API clients

This repository includes two clients for the [COVIDcast
API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html), which
provides access to Delphi's COVID-19 indicators and related data:

* R: [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/)
* Python: [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/)

our signals:
