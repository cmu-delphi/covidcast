Changelog
=========

v0.1.3, January 5, 2021
-------------------------

- New feature: :py:func:`covidcast.signal` now retrieves HHS (``geo_type="hhs"``) and nation (``geo_type="nation"``)
  level signals (if available from the Epidata API).

v0.1.2, December 10, 2020
-------------------------

- Bug fix: Fix issue where introduction of weekly signals broke the :py:func:`covidcast.metadata` function.

v0.1.1, November 22, 2020
-------------------------

- Bug fix: A shapefile packaging issue, which broke
  :py:func:`covidcast.plot` for metropolitan statistical areas and
  hospital referral regions, is now resolved.

- Update: ``Direction`` is no longer supported and has been removed from the
  output of :py:func:`covidcast.signal`. To measure increasing or decreasing
  trends in signals, we recommend implementing your own method based on your
  application's specific needs.

- New feature: Functions :py:func:`covidcast.fips_to_abbr` and
  :py:func:`covidcast.abbr_to_fips` to convert between state FIPS codes and
  their abbreviations.

- New feature: Function :py:func:`covidcast.plot` now supports bubble plots with
  the argument ``plot_type="bubble"``


v0.1.0, October 1, 2020
-----------------------

- New feature: Functions :py:func:`covidcast.fips_to_name`,
  :py:func:`covidcast.cbsa_to_name`, and :py:func:`covidcast.abbr_to_name` are
  provided to convert FIPS codes, CBSA IDs, and two-letter abbreviations to
  county names, metropolitan statistical area (MSA) names, and state names,
  respectively.

- New feature: Functions :py:func:`covidcast.name_to_fips`,
  :py:func:`covidcast.name_to_cbsa`, and :py:func:`covidcast.name_to_fips` are
  provided to convert human-readable names into FIPS codes, CBSA IDs, and state
  abbreviations, for use when querying the COVIDcast API.

- New feature: Function :py:func:`covidcast.animate` can take a DataFrame returned by
  :py:func:`covidcast.signal` and generate an animated video of the signal over time.

- New feature: Function :py:func:`covidcast.plot_choropleth` can now plot signals for
  hospital referral regions (HRRs) and metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), in addition
  to states and counties.

- New feature: Function :py:func:`covidcast.aggregate_signals` shifts and combines
  multiple signals into a single DataFrame for convenient signal comparisons across
  time.

- Bug fix: The ``time_value`` argument to the :py:func:`covidcast.plot_choropleth`
  function can now accept `datetime <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html>`_
  ``datetime`` and ``date`` objects, instead of only `pandas Timestamps
  <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.html>`_.

- Bug fix: :py:func:`covidcast.signal` no longer returns duplicate values if duplicate
  ``geo_values`` are provided in the function call.

- Deprecated function: :py:func:`covidcast.plot_choropleth` has been deprecated and is
  not replaced by :py:func:`covidcast.plot`.

v0.0.9, August 30, 2020
-----------------------

- New feature: :py:func:`covidcast.plot_choropleth` and :py:func:`covidcast.get_geo_df`
  add mapping and plotting capabilities that can be used with the data returned by
  :py:func:`covidcast.signal`. See the :ref:`function documentation <plotting-data>`
  and :ref:`plotting examples <plotting-examples>` for more details.

v0.0.8, July 26, 2020
---------------------

- New feature: :py:func:`covidcast.signal` now accepts arguments ``as_of``,
  ``issues``, and ``lag`` to request data that was issued on a specific date, or
  only the data that was available on a certain date. The default behavior is to
  return the only most up-to-date data, matching the client's previous behavior,
  but users can now request prior versions of data when desired. See the
  function documentation for more details.

v0.0.7, June 29, 2020
---------------------

- Addition: :py:func:`covidcast.metadata` returns a data frame of all available
  sources and signals, with metadata about each.

v0.0.6, June 22, 2020
---------------------

- Minor API change: :py:func:`covidcast.signal` now takes a ``geo_values``
  argument that can include multiple geographies, rather than a single
  ``geo_value`` argument.

- Improved documentation.

v0.0.5, June 19, 2020
---------------------

First public usable release.
