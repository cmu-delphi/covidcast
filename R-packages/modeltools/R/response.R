#' Compute the corresponding observed response values for a set of signals.
#'
#' The response for an observed data point at time `t` is defined as the mean of observed values on
#' days `t + s` through `t + e` (inclusive) multiplied by `e - s`, where `s` and `e` are the number
#' of days from `forecast_date` to the start and end, respectively, of the next full
#' `incidence_period`.  We choose to take the mean and multiply by the incidence period length
#' rather than simply sum the observed values in order to avoid treating missing values as 0.
#'
#' @param signals Wide data frame of signals.  We expect the following columns:
#'     \itemize{
#'     \item{`geo_value`}{Strings of geographic locations.}
#'     \item{`time_value`}{Dates of training data.}
#'     \item{Covariate columns}{Columns with names of the form `value-{days}:{signal}` or
#'         `value+0:{signal} whose values correspond to `{signal}` `{days}` before `time_value`}
#'     }
#' @param response_name Name of response signal.  The value of the response variable on a single
#'     day should be located in column `value+0:{response_name}` of `signals`.
#' @param forecast_date Date on which the forecast will be made
#' @param incidence_period Time period over which the response should be summed.
#' @param ahead integer or vector of integer ahead values
#'
#' @return Data frame of signals equal to `signals` with `length(ahead)` additional columns with
#'     names `response+{a}:{response_name}` corresponding to the response variable at ahead `a`.
