#' Create a data frame of score cards
#'
#' Performs backtesting, through the following steps:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Takes a list of predictions cards (as created by
#'   [get_predictions()]). 
#'   \item Downloads from the COVIDcast API the latest available data to compute
#'   what actually occurred (summing the response over the incidence period).
#'   \item Computes various user-specified error measures.
#' }
#' The result is a data frame of "score cards", where each row corresponds to
#' a distinct ahead value. A score card is a data frame in which each row
#' corresponds to a location-day pair, and the columns give the values of the
#' error measures (along with other information including the forecast
#' distributions and the actual response values).
#'
#' Backfill refers to the process by which some data sources go back in time
#' updating previously reported values. Suppose it is September 14 and we are 
#' evaluating our predictions for what happened in the previous epiweek
#' (September 6 through 12). Although we may be able to calculate a value for
#' "actual", we might not trust this value since on September 16, backfill may
#' occur changing what is known about the period September 6 through 12.  There are
#' two consequences of this phenomenon.  First, running this function on
#' different dates may result in different estimates of the error. Second, we
#' may not trust the evaluations we get that are too recent.  The parameter
#' `backfill_buffer` specifies how long of a buffer period we should
#' enforce.  This will be dependent on the data source and signal and is left
#' to the user to determine.  If backfill is not relevant for the particular
#' signal you are predicting, then you can set `backfill_buffer` to 0.
#'
#' @param predictions_cards tibble of predictions
#'   that are all for the same prediction task, meaning they are for the same
#'   response, incidence period,and geo type. Forecasts may be for a
#'   different forecast date or forecaster.
#'   A predictions card may be created by the function
#'   [get_predictions()], downloaded with [get_covidhub_predictions()] or
#'   possibly created manually.
#' @param err_measures Named list of one or more functions, where each function
#'   takes a data frame with three columns `quantile`, `value` and `actual`
#'   (i.e., observed) returns a scalar measure of error. Null or an empty list
#'   may be provided if scoring is not desired.
#' @param backfill_buffer How many days until response is deemed trustworthy
#'   enough to be taken as correct? See details for more.
#' @param side_truth you can optionally provide your own truth data (observed).
#'   Adding this column bypasses all checks to get appropriate data as
#'   reported at the time of the forecast. This column should either be a vector
#'   the same length as `predictions_cards` or a data frame that will be
#'   joined to `predictions_cards` by all available columns. If a data frame,
#'   the observed data should be named `actual`
#' @param grp_vars character vector of named columns in the predictions_cards
#'  such that the combination gives a unique (quantile) prediction. Ignored if
#'  `predictions_cards` is of the type returned by [get_covidhub_predictions()]
#'  or [get_predictions()] (class is `predictions_cards`)
#'
#' @return tibble of "score cards". Contains the same information as the
#'   `predictions_cards()` with additional columns for each err_measure and
#'   for the truth (named `actual`). All the columns may be necessary for
#'   some types of plotting, but it may be useful to shrink this down
