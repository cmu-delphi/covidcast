# Delphi Then

- In 2012, we formed [Delphi](https://delphi.cmu.edu) to "develop the theory and practice of epidemic forecasting, and its role in decision-making"
- Led by Roni Rosenfeld and Ryan Tibshirani, with several participating faculty and graduate students 
- Participated in annual CDC flu forecasting challenges starting in 2013, earned top place in several 
- Awarded `r col("CDC Center of Excellence")` for flu forecasting in 2019 
- Published open code and data, including numerous influenza surveillance streams 

# Delphi Now

- We've gone from 7 members to over 35, to support the COVID-19 response
- Added many smart folks from CMU, but also Stanford, UC Davis, USC ...
- Beyond (before?) forecasting: we've been `r col("focusing, now more than ever, on data")`
- *This problem is so hard that our best weapon is a diversity of data sources*

# COVIDcast

The COVIDcast project has many parts: 
    
1. Unique relationships with partners in tech and healthcare granting us access to data on pandemic activity
2. Code and infrastructure to build `r col("COVID-19 indicators")`, continuously-updated and geographically-comprehensive
3. A historical database of all indicators, including `r col("revision tracking")`, with over 500 million observations
4. A [public API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html) serving new indicators daily (and [R and Python packages](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_clients.html) for client support)
5. [Interactive maps and graphics](https://covidcast.cmu.edu) to display our indicators
6. `r col("Forecasting and modeling")` work building on the indicators

# Severity Pyramid

![](severity_pyramid.svg)

# What Is This Used For?

- Forecasting, e.g.:
    * Case incidence: for vaccine trial site selection
    * Hospitalizations: for planning and preparedness 
- Nowcasting, e.g.: 
    * Situational awareness: testing and resource allocation
    * Decision-making: re-opening criteria, school closures
 - General epidemiological research, e.g.:
    * What behaviors are linked to spread?
    * What symptoms are linked to cases?

# COVIDcast Indicators

![](covidcast_indicators.svg)

# COVIDcast Indicators (Cont.)

- Available through the [COVIDcast API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html), updated daily
- Most (nearly all) available at the `r col("county level")`
- For a full list see our [signal documentation site](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html) 
- Provide [R and Python packages](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_clients.html) for client support

# This Talk

- Bunch of examples 
- API specification
- R package tools
- Few more examples

Note: examples are meant to be demos, all code included

<br>

Next talks: Facebook surveys, medical claims data, etc.

# Example: Deaths

How many people have died from COVID-19 per day, in my state, since March 1?

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
library(covidcast)
deaths = covidcast_signal(data_source = "usa-facts", 
                          signal = "deaths_7dav_incidence_num", 
                          start_day = "2020-03-01", end_day = "2020-08-30",
                          geo_type = "state", geo_values = "pa")

plot(deaths, plot_type = "line", 
     title = "COVID-19 deaths in PA (7-day trailing average)")
```

# Example: Hospitalizations

What percentage of daily hospital admissions are due to COVID-19 in PA, NY, TX?

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
hosp = covidcast_signal(data_source = "hospital-admissions", 
                        signal = "smoothed_adj_covid19",
                        start_day = "2020-03-01", end_day = "2020-08-28",
                        geo_type = "state", geo_values = c("pa", "ny", "tx"))

plot(hosp, plot_type = "line", 
     title = "% of hospital admissions due to COVID-19")
```

# Example: Cases 

What does the current COVID-19 incident case rate look like, nationwide?

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=7}
cases = covidcast_signal(data_source = "usa-facts", 
                         signal = "confirmed_7dav_incidence_prop",
                         start_day = "2020-08-30", end_day = "2020-08-30")

plot(cases, title = "Daily new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people")
```

# Example: Cases (Cont.)

What does the current COVID-19 cumulative case rate look like, nationwide?

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=7}
cases = covidcast_signal(data_source = "usa-facts", 
                         signal = "confirmed_cumulative_prop",
                         start_day = "2020-08-30", end_day = "2020-08-30")

plot(cases, title = "Cumulative COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people", 
     choro_params = list(legend_n = 6))
```

# Example: Cases (Cont.)

Where is the current COVID-19 cumulative case rate greater than 2%?

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=7}
plot(cases, choro_col = c("#D3D3D3", "#FFC0CB"), 
     title = "Cumulative COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people",
     choro_params = list(breaks = c(0, 2000), legend_width = 5))
```

# Example: Doctor's Visits

How do some major cities compare in terms of doctor's visits due to COVID-like illness?

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
dv = covidcast_signal(data_source = "doctor-visits", 
                      signal = "smoothed_adj_cli", 
                      start_day = "2020-03-01", end_day = "2020-08-28",
                      geo_type = "msa", 
                      geo_values = name_to_cbsa(c("Pittsburgh", "New York", 
                                                  "San Antonio", "Miami")))

plot(dv, plot_type = "line", 
     title = "% of doctor's visits due to COVID-like illness")
```

# Example: Symptoms

How do my county and my friend's county compare in terms of people reporting that they know somebody with COVID symptoms?

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
sympt = covidcast_signal(data_source = "fb-survey", 
                         signal = "smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli",
                         start_day = "2020-04-15", end_day = "2020-08-30",
                         geo_values = c(name_to_fips("Allegheny"),
                                        name_to_fips("Fulton", state = "GA")))

plot(sympt, plot_type = "line", range = range(sympt$value),
     title = "% of people who know somebody with COVID symptoms")
```

# API Specification

The COVIDcast API is based on HTTP GET queries and returns data in JSON form. The base URL is https://api.covidcast.cmu.edu/epidata/api.php?source=covidcast 

<br>

| Parameter | Description | Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `data_source` | data source | `doctor-visits` or `fb-survey` |
| `signal` | signal derived from data source | `smoothed_cli` or `smoothed_adj_cli` |
| `time_type` | temporal resolution of the signal | `day` or `week` |
| `geo_type` | spatial resolution of the signal | `county`, `hrr`, `msa`, or `state` |
| `time_values` | time units over which events happened | `20200406` or `20200406-20200410` |
| `geo_value` | location codes, depending on `geo_type` | `*` for all, or `pa` for Pennsylvania |

# Example: API Query

Estimated % COVID-like illness on April 6, 2020 from the Facebook survey, in Allegheny County: https://api.covidcast.cmu.edu/epidata/api.php?source=covidcast&data_source=fb-survey&signal=raw_cli&time_type=day&geo_type=county&time_values=20200406&geo_value=42003 

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
res = readLines("https://api.covidcast.cmu.edu/epidata/api.php?source=covidcast&data_source=fb-survey&signal=raw_cli&time_type=day&geo_type=county&time_values=20200406&geo_value=42003")
prettify(res)
```

# API Documentation

For full details, see the [API documentation site](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html). There you'll also find details on:

- [Data sources and signals](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html) 
- [Geographic coding](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_geography.html)
- [COVIDcast metadata](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_meta.html)

# As Of, Issues, Lag

By default the API returns the most recent data for each `time_value`. We also provide access to all previous versions of the data, using the following optional parameters:

<br>

| Parameter | To get data ... | Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `as_of` | as if we queried the API on a particular date | `20200406` |
| `issues` | published at a particular date or date range | `20200406` or `20200406-20200410` |
| `lag` | published a certain number of time units after events occured | `1` or `3` |

# Data Revisions 

Why would we need this? Because many data sources are subject to `r col("revisions")`:

- Case and death counts frequently corrected/adjusted by authorities
- Medical claims data can take weeks to be submitted and/or processed
- Testing/lab data can be backlogged for a variety of reasons, etc.

This presents a challenge to modelers: e.g., we have to learn how to forecast based on the `r col("data we'd have at the time")`, not updates that would arrive later

To accommodate, we log revisions even when the original data source does not!

# covidcast R Package

We also provide an R package called [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/) for API access. Highlights: 

- API querying:
    * Same specification structure (many default parameters) 
    * Full support for data revisions (as of, issues, lag)
- Plotting functionality:
    * Choropleth maps (customizable: colors scales, etc.)
    * Bubble maps (customizable: size scales, etc.)
    * Time series plots (pretty basic, just add ggplot layers)
- Basic signal processing:
    * Correlations sliced by location, or by time

# Example: Backfill in Doctor's Visits Signal

Let's examine the revisions or "backfill" present in our doctor's visits signal. We'll look at this signal over the month of June, and query the API "as of" each week from June 8 through August 1:

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
# Loop over "as of" dates, fetch data from the API for each one
as_ofs = seq(as.Date("2020-06-08"), as.Date("2020-08-01"), by = "week")
states = c("az", "ca", "pa", "ny")
dv_as_of = map_dfr(as_ofs, function(as_of) {
  covidcast_signal(data_source = "doctor-visits", signal = "smoothed_adj_cli",
                   start_day = "2020-06-01", end_day = "2020-06-30", 
                   geo_type = "state", geo_values = states, as_of = as_of)
})
dv_as_of$geo_value = factor(dv_as_of$geo_value, levels = states, 
                            labels = abbr_to_name(states, ignore.case = TRUE))

# Now plot the each "as of" time series curve, faceted by state
ggplot(dv_as_of, aes(x = time_value, y = value)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = factor(issue))) + facet_wrap(vars(geo_value)) + 
  labs(color = "Issue date", x = "Date", y = "% doctor's visits due to CLI") +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.pos = "bottom")
```

# Example: Correlations Between Cases and Deaths

Now let's examine the correlations between COVID-19 cases and deaths, per day, across counties. We'll look at Spearman correlation, starting March 1. Then repeat but for cases lagged back 7 days:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Fetch confirmed cases and deaths, at the county level, since March 1
start_day = "2020-03-01"
end_day = "2020-08-30"
cases = covidcast_signal("usa-facts", "confirmed_7dav_incidence_num", 
                         start_day, end_day)
deaths = covidcast_signal("usa-facts", "deaths_7dav_incidence_num", 
                          start_day, end_day)

# Consider only "active" counties with at least 500 cumulative cases so far
case_num = 500
geo_values = covidcast_signal("usa-facts", "confirmed_cumulative_num",
                              max(cases$time), max(cases$time)) %>%
  filter(value >= case_num) %>% pull(geo_value)
cases_act = cases %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)
deaths_act = deaths %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)

# Compute correlations, per time, over all counties. Both with original time
# alignment, and with cases lagged backwards in time by 7 days
df_cor1 = covidcast_cor(cases_act, deaths_act, by = "time_value", 
                        method = "spearman")
df_cor2 = covidcast_cor(cases_act, deaths_act, by = "time_value", 
                        method = "spearman", dt_x = -7)

# Stack rowwise into one data frame, then plot time series
df_cor = rbind(df_cor1, df_cor2)
df_cor$dt = factor(c(rep(0, nrow(df_cor1)), rep(-7, nrow(df_cor2))))
ggplot(df_cor, aes(x = time_value, y = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = dt)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation between cases and deaths",
       subtitle = sprintf("Over counties with at least %i cases", case_num),
       x = "Date", y = "Correlation") + 
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
