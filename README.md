Public-facing tools supporting [Delphi's](https://delphi.cmu.edu)
[COVIDcast](https://covidcast.cmu.edu) effort. 

## API clients

This repository includes two clients for the [COVIDcast
API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html), which
provides access to Delphi's COVID-19 indicators and related data:

- R: [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/)
- Python: [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/)

## R notebooks

This repository also includes some (very preliminary) R notebooks for monitoring
our signals: 

- [Signal correlations](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/R-notebooks/signal_correlations.html)
- [Facebook survey dashboard](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/R-notebooks/fb_dashboard.html)
