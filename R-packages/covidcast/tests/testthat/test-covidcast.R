# Many of these tests use mockery::with_mock_api. This replaces calls to the
# live API server, instead returning static JSON files from disk. Three
# weaknesses to be aware of:
#
# 1. The HTTP URL and parameters are hashed into a single filename to use. This
# means that you can't have the query return one thing, then have the same query
# return something else, for instance to test how the client handles different
# types of errors.
#
# 2. Once you've written a test, it can be difficult to find the file storing
# the JSON or CSV needed for that test. We hence store the filename in comments
# adjacent to every call. (Note that we request CSVs from the API for
# covidcast_signal, and httptest suggests filenames ending in .json by default.
# You can use .csv instead and httptest will correctly locate those files.)
#
# 3. covidcast_signal() calls covidcast_meta() unconditionally. We hence need a
# single meta file that suffices for all tests that call covidcast_signal().
#
# Other tests use mockery::stub and mockery::mock, which come with their own
# pros and cons.
#
# with_mock_api:
#   Replace all calls to a specified function that use specified arguments
#   with the result in the corresponding file.
# mock:
#   Replace all calls to a specified function with the arguments of the mock, in
#   order (i.e. The n-th call to the function returns the n-th argument of the
#   mock).
# stub:
#   Replaces all calls from a specified function to another specified function
#   with a specified result (without regard for arguments). The specified
#   result can be a function, so using stub with a mock object allows you to
#   return different values for each call. By default, only direct calls to a
#   function are stubbed. There is a depth argument to allow stubbing
#   indirect calls as well (i.e. You call f() -> g() -> h() and need to stub g's
#   call to h), but there is a bug in mockery that should be fixed with the next
#   release. See https://github.com/r-lib/mockery/pull/39.
