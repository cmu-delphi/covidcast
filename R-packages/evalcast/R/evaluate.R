#' Create a list of score cards
#'
#' Performs backtesting, through the following steps:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Takes a list of predictions cards (as created by
#'   [get_predictions()]). These should be from a single forecaster, each card 
#'   corresponding to a different forecast date.
#'   \item Downloads from the COVIDcast API the latest available data to compute
#'   what actually occurred (summing the response over the incidence period).
#'   \item Computes various user-specified error measures.
#' }
#' The result is a list of "score cards", where each list element corresponds to
#' a distinct ahead value. A score card is a data frame in which each row
#' corresponds to a location-day pair, and the columns give the values of the
#' error measures (along with other information including the forecast
#' distributions and the actual response values).
#'
#' Backfill refers to the process by which some data sources go back in time
#' updating previously reported values. Suppose it is September 14 and we are 
#' evaluating our predictions for what happened in the previous epiweek
#' (September 6 through 12). Although we may be able to calculate a value for
#' "actual", we might not trust this value since on September 16, backfill may
#' occur changing what is known about the period September 6 through 12.  There are
#' two consequences of this phenomenon.  First, running this function on
#' different dates may result in different estimates of the error. Second, we
#' may not trust the evaluations we get that are too recent.  The parameter
#' `backfill_buffer` specifies how long of a buffer period we should
#' enforce.  This will be dependent on the data source and signal and is left
#' to the user to determine.  If backfill is not relevant for the particular
#' signal you are predicting, then you can set `backfill_buffer` to 0.
#'
#' @param predictions_cards List of predictions cards from the same forecaster 
#'   that are all for the same response, incidence period, and geo type. Each 
#'   should be from a different forecast date or for a different ahead.  A 
#'   predictions card is created by the function [get_predictions()].
#' @param err_measures Named list of one or more functions, where each function
#'   takes a data frame with two columns `probs` and `quantiles` and an actual
#'   (i.e., observed) scalar value and returns some measure of error.  If empty,
#'   returns the scorecard without any error measure columns.
#' @param backfill_buffer How many days until response is deemed trustworthy
#'   enough to be taken as correct? See details for more.
#' 
#' @return List of "score cards", with one element per ahead value.
