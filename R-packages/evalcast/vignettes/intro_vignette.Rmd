The `evalcast` package provides the infrastructure for developing and evaluating probabilistic forecasters that are based on data obtained with the [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/) R package.  A unique feature of the `covidcast` API is that it can retrieve data that would have been available *as of* a certain date.  This accounts for a difficult property of working with certain COVID-19 data sources, which is that they may be backfilled (retrospectively updated).  Failing to account for backfill can lead to poorly trained forecasters and overly optimistic retrospective evaluations.  The `evalcast` package is designed to help forecasters avoid these pitfalls.


## Testing forecasters
We will use the included `baseline_forecaster` to demonstrate how to backtest a forecaster and compare its predictions to contemporaneous forecasts submitted to CovidHub. While `baseline_forecaster` is very simple, it can be used as a template for creating more sophisticated forecasters.

The format of a forecaster is aligned with the [CovidHub submission instructions](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/blob/master/data-processed/README.md) and with the [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/) R package.

### Specify the signals that will be used by forecaster

We start by specifying which signals the forecaster will be using.  See [here](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html) for a full list of signals available through the `covidcast` API.  Each signal is specified by two strings: `data_source` and `signal`.  Optionally, we can specify how far back in time we will want data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
signals <- tibble(data_source = "jhu-csse", 
                  signal = c("deaths_incidence_num", "confirmed_incidence_num"), 
                  start_day = "2020-06-15")
signals
```

### Run the forecaster on some dates

Within the `evalcast` framework, forecasters do not directly retrieve historic data. Instead, `get_predictions` provides *only the data that would have been available at the time* to the specified forecaster in order to generate retrospective predictions.

```{r}
library(evalcast)
library(covidcast)
library(lubridate)

forecast_dates <- as_date(get_forecast_dates("CMU-TimeSeries"))
forecast_dates_july <- forecast_dates[forecast_dates >= "2020-07-01" & forecast_dates <= "2020-07-31"]

# Retrieve past predictions from CovidHub
predictions_cards_yyg <- get_covidhub_predictions("YYG-ParamSearch", forecast_dates_july)
predictions_cards_cmu <- get_covidhub_predictions("CMU-TimeSeries", forecast_dates_july)

# Make new predictions using baseline_forecaster
predictions_cards <- get_predictions(baseline_forecaster,
                                     name_of_forecaster = "baseline",
                                     signals = signals,
                                     forecast_dates = forecast_dates_july,
                                     incidence_period = "epiweek",
                                     ahead = 3,
                                     geo_type = "state")
```

`baseline_forecaster` created a list of `r length(predictions_cards)` predictions cards, (one for each `(forecast date, ahead)` pair).  Let's look at a predictions card:

```{r}
predictions_cards[[1]]
```

Forecasts are probabilistic, meaning that rather than predicting a single value, a distribution of values is generated. For example, the baseline forecaster would have predicted the following distribution in California for `r attributes(predictions_cards_cmu[[1]])$ahead` week(s) after `r attributes(predictions_cards_cmu[[1]])$forecast_date`
```{r}
pc <- predictions_cards_cmu[[1]]
ca_fips = covidcast::name_to_fips("California")
ca_code = substr(ca_fips, 0, 2) # States are identified by a 2 character code
pc[pc$location == ca_code, ]$forecast_distribution[[1]]
```

### Evaluate the performance of a forecaster

Now that we've made these predictions, we'd like to know how well they perform.  By default, `evalcast` uses the following three performance measures, but these can be easily substituted:

```{r}
err_measures <- list(wis = weighted_interval_score,
                     ae = absolute_error,
                     coverage_80 = interval_coverage(alpha = 0.2))
```

We may now create scorecards for each forecaster's predictions or for a filtered subset. 

```{r}
scorecards_yyg <- evaluate_predictions(filter_predictions(predictions_cards_yyg, ahead = 3), 
                                   err_measures, 
                                   backfill_buffer = 10)
pcards_cmu_death3 <- filter_predictions(predictions_cards_cmu, 
                                        ahead = 3,
                                        response_data_source = "jhu-csse",
                                        response_signal = "deaths_incidence_num")
scorecards_cmu <- evaluate_predictions(pcards_cmu_death3, 
                                   err_measures, 
                                   backfill_buffer = 10)
scorecards <- evaluate_predictions(filter_predictions(predictions_cards, ahead = 3), 
                                   err_measures, 
                                   backfill_buffer = 10)
```

Let's look at the `baseline_forecaster`'s scorecard for 3-epiweek ahead forecasts.

```{r}
scorecards[[1]]
```

**Technical note:** What does `backfill_buffer = 10` do?  When we evaluate a forecaster in backtesting we are assuming that we know what actually occurred.  However, in light of backfill, we may not trust the data for some period of time.  The argument `backfill_buffer` allows us to specify how many days until we believe that the data has "settled down" and is unlikely to be updated further.  The choice of this argument will depend on the particular signal you are forecasting.

### Plots of performance measures

`evalcast` provides a number of tools to visually assess a forecaster (including comparisons with other forecasters):

```{r}
scorecards_list <- c(scorecards_yyg,scorecards_cmu,scorecards)
plot_measure(scorecards_list, "wis")
plot_measure(scorecards_list, "ae", type = "dotplot") + scale_x_log10()
plot_calibration(scorecards_cmu[[1]], type = "wedge")
plot_calibration(scorecards_cmu[[1]], type = "traditional")
plot_coverage(list(scorecards_yyg[[1]],
                  scorecards_cmu[[1]]))
plot_width(scorecards_cmu)
```


## Cumulative forecasting

While the above describes incident forecasting, the same `evalcast` functions can also be used for cumulative forecasting.

- For example, for `k`-day-ahead cumulative forecasting, choose a cumulative signal from `covidcast` (e.g., `deaths_cumulative_num`), set `incidence_period = "day"` and `ahead = k`.

- For example, for `k`-week-ahead cumulative epiweek forecasting, do the same as above but with `ahead = 7 * k`.
