\usage{
get_predictions_single_date(
  forecaster,
  name_of_forecaster,
  signals,
  forecast_date,
  incidence_period,
  ahead,
  geo_type,
  geo_values
)
}
\arguments{
\item{forecaster}{the forecaster}

\item{name_of_forecaster}{the name of the forecaster}

\item{signals}{a tibble with columns "data_source" and "signal" that
specifies which variables from the covidcast API will be used by
my_forecaster. The first row of signals is taken to be the response.   If
using incidence_period "epiweek", thre response should be something for
which summing daily values over an epiweek makes sense (e.g., counts or
proportions but not log(counts) or log(proportions)).  Available data
sources and signals are documented in the \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html}{COVIDcast signal documentation}
documentation.  Can optionally include a column "first_day" giving the
earliest day of data needed from that data source.}

\item{forecast_date}{the forecast date}

\item{incidence_period}{either "epiweek" or "day"}

\item{ahead}{vector of (one or more) integers.  How many epiweeks/days ahead
are you forecasting?  If incidence_period is "epiweek" and forecast_date is
Sunday or Monday, then ahead = 1 means the epiweek that includes the
forecast date;  if forecast_date is Tuesday-Saturday, then it is the
following epiweek. If incidence_period is "day" then ahead = 1 means the
day after forecast date.}

\item{geo_type}{one of the geographical types, matching the terms used on the
api ("county", "dma", "hrr", "msa", "state")}

\item{geo_values}{a vector or list of locations whose data will be passed to
my_forecaster. The default, "*", fetches all that is available in API.}
