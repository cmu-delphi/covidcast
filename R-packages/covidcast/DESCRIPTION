Description: Tools for Delphi's 'COVIDcast Epidata' API: data access, maps and
    time series plotting, and basic signal processing. The API includes a
    collection of numerous indicators relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic in the
    United States, including official reports, de-identified aggregated medical
    claims data, large-scale surveys of symptoms and public behavior, and
    mobility data, typically updated daily and at the county level. All data
    sources are documented at
    <https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html>.
