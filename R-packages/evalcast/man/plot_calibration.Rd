}
\arguments{
\item{predictions_cards}{Either one predictions_card or several joined
together using bind_rows().}

\item{type}{One of "wedgeplot" or "traditional"}

\item{facet_rows}{A variable name to facet data over. Creates a
separate row of plots for each value of specified variable. Can be used
with \code{facet_cols} to create a grid of plots.  Should be passed to
plot_calibration when customized.}

\item{facet_cols}{Same as \code{facet_rows}, but with columns.}

\item{grp_vars}{variables over which to compare calibration. These
determines the color of the lines and faceting depending on \code{type}}

\item{avg_vars}{variables over which we average to determine the calibration.}

\item{geo_type}{String indicating geographical type, such as "county", or
"state". See the \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_geography.html}{COVIDcast Geographic Coding documentation}
for available options.}

\item{backfill_buffer}{How many days until response is deemed trustworthy
enough to be taken as correct?.}
