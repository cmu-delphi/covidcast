\usage{
plot_coverage(
  scorecards,
  alpha = 0.2,

  legend.position = "bottom"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scorecards}{List of different score cards, all on the same forecasting
task (i.e., same ahead, etc.).}

\item{alpha}{If \code{type = "all"}, then the location of the vertical line is
1-alpha; if \code{type = "one"} then 1-alpha is the nominal interval coverage
shown.}

\item{type}{One of "all" or "none", indicating whether to show coverage
across all nominal levels (in which case averaging is performed across
forecast dates and locations) or whether to show it for one specific alpha
value.}

\item{legend_position}{Legend position, the default being "bottom".}
